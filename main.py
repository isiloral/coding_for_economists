#Exercise: Indexing and slicing

url = 'https://github.com/codedthinking/tender-home-bias/releases/download/v1.0/ted-sample.csv'

#Use indexing, slicing to fill in the following output.
#Copy/paste is not allowed

file_name = url[start_index:end_index]
#use len() function: len('ted-sample.csv'). This will give the length of the searched string.
print(file_name) #'ted-sample.csv'


Protocol =
print(protcol) #'https'

host_name = 
#again by using len(), you can find it. 
print(host_name) #'github.com'

#Use string composition to construct https://github.com/ted-sample.csv
